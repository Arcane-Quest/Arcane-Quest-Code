# Q&A
- Q. How do I reset my progress?
  - Remove the data under `saves/main_save/map_data` and other data inside the `main_save` folder.
  - Important: for the code to work properly, you ***must*** have the `saves/main_save` 
  *folder* (not the contents inside) as well as the `saves/main_save/map_data` 
  folder and `saves/main_save/entity_data` folder.
    - It may be simpler to just re-download the code
